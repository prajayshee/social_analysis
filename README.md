Social Media Insights Generator
1. Overview
  This project is designed to analyze social media engagement metrics, leveraging the power of LangFlow workflows, DataStax for efficient data storage and querying, and OpenAI GPT for generating actionable insights. It was built as part of the Level Supermind Hackathon.

2. Features
  LangFlow Workflow: Streamlines interaction between user input, data processing, and insight generation.
  DataStax Integration: Manages large-scale social media data storage and querying using Cassandra.
  GPT Insights: Provides AI-generated analysis for posts based on engagement metrics.
  Dynamic Web Interface: Displays average engagement metrics and allows users to filter and analyze posts by type.

3. How It Works
  I. Data Ingestion: Social media post data (likes, shares, comments, post types) is stored in a Cassandra database using DataStax.
  II. Querying with DataStax: Data is retrieved via efficient CQL queries for various analyses, such as average engagement metrics or post-specific statistics.
  III. AI-Powered Analysis: GPT-4 generates insights based on the queried data, providing a deeper understanding of trends and engagement patterns.
  IV. Visualization: A Django-powered web interface displays the insights and allows further exploration by post types.
